      <p>
      Colorado Loving Care was founded in Colorado in 2021 with a mission to
      create a positive impact on the lives of adults with intellectual and
      developmental disabilities. Our primary focus is ensuring the well-being
      and success of the individuals who receive our support. While our hallmark
      is delivering high-quality and timely services, our true passion lies in
      providing safe and nurturing homes for all those under our care.
      </p>
      <p>
      As an agency, we specialize in the recruitment, training, and oversight
      of host homes, family caregivers, and individuals who meet the necessary
      qualifications. Colorado Loving Care conducts an annual renewal
      process, offers vigilant monitoring, facilitates suitable placements,
      and provides continuous training and assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our host providers and
       family caregivers benefit from substantial support. We function as
       advocates not only for the individuals who receive support from
       Colorado Loving Care but also for our dedicated providers.
